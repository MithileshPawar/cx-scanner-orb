# Pipeline Parameters
## These parameters are used internally by orb-tools. Skip to the Jobs section.
parameters:
  run-integration-tests:
    description: An internal flag to prevent integration test from running before a development version has been created.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  dev-orb-version:
    description: >
      The development version of the orb to test.
      This value is automatically adjusted by the "trigger-integration-tests-workflow" job to correspond with the specific version created by the commit and should not be edited.
      A "dev:alpha" version must exist for the initial pipeline run.
    type: string
    default: "dev:alpha"

jobs:
  # Define one or more jobs which will utilize your orb's commands and parameters to validate your changes.
  integration-test-1:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/base:stable
    steps:
      - checkout
      # "greet" is a sample command packaged with this orb config.
      # This sample integration test will run as long as the greet command exists. Once you remove the greet command you should remove this line.
      # Push new changes first, before adding new tests to your config.
      - cx-scanner-orb/greet

workflows:
  # Prior to producing a development orb (which requires credentials) basic validation, linting, and even unit testing can be performed.
  # This workflow will run on every commit
  test-pack:
    jobs:
      - orb-tools/lint # Lint Yaml files
      - orb-tools/pack # Pack orb source
      # If you accept building open source forks, protect your secrects behind a restricted context.
      # A job containing restricted context (which holds your orb publishing credentials) may only be accessed by a user with proper permissions.
      # An open source user may begin a pipeline with a PR, and once the pipeline is approved by an authorized user at this point, the pipeline will continue with the proper context permissions.

      # Publish development version(s) of the orb.

      # as that will determine whether a patch, minor or major
      # version will be published or if publishing should
      # be skipped.
      # e.g. [semver:patch] will cause a patch version to be published.
